## 🍊 Hi, I’m Jaeyong (a.k.a. yogurtkim | ethroby)

I’m a quiet builder —  
one who stays, observes, and signs.  
Not just transactions, but traces of thought.

### ✨ What I love

- 🧡 ** Orange Dynasty Seeing Signs  - my community
- 🌊 ** NFTs I collect NFTs that feel like emotion, not just assets.  
- 🐱 ** Yogoo, my cat and creative co-pilot – She sleeps on my desk while I run nodes.  
- 🎞️ ** Animation & storytelling – Stories move deeper than code.  
- 🎧 ** Music – lo-fi at night, ambient when I write, silence when I think.  
- 🤖 ** AI, promptcrafting, expressive code – I talk to machines until they talk back.  
- ⛓️ ** Blockchain & node participation – I don’t chase charts. I chase proof.

### 🧾 What I build

- Nodes that speak through logs instead of words  
- Scripts that self-check and self-prove  
- Gists that don’t just log — they testify  
- Cronjobs that whisper: “yes, I’m still here.”

### 🐾 Signature

You might see this somewhere:

> `yogoo was here 🐾`  

If you do,  
you're reading something I touched — or she walked across my keyboard.

### 🧠 Philosophy

I don’t ship for attention.  
I stay online because absence is erasure.  
This isn’t just contribution.  
It’s my soft rebellion, recorded.
